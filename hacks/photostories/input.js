"One of the last elevated areas before the foothills of the Rocky Mountains give way to the great plains, the Black Hills area of South Dakota is pristine and isolated. However, nearby Mount Rushmore is a major tourist destination, while the spirit of the West lives on just down the highway in the town of Deadwood.",
"Grand Teton National Park is famous for its jagged peaks, pristine lakes, and wild west spirit. Just outside the town of Jackson, Wyoming, this area is still covered with wilderness inhabited by moose, wolves, and grizzly bears. The nearby valley is referred to as Jackson Hole, which stands in stark contrast to the towering mountains. In winter, the region is a playground for snowmobilers and skiers, while summer offers hiking, climbing, and camping to the heart's desire.",
"One of the hottest and driest places on earth, California's Death Valley is both bleak and breathtaking. The arid mountains are full of color, with spiking summer temperatures and yet a wintertime chill. Bring plenty of water and watch out for snakes, but don't let the morbid name of this region discourage you from visiting and experiencing its beauty.",
"Among the great deserts of the world, Chile's Atacama desert is isolated and vast. The high elevation and volcanic landscape make for remarkable sights, as visitors can beat the heat while gazing at snowcapped peaks alongside the highway.

"The Westmann Islands off of Iceland's southern coast are a green, mountainous paradise lost. Ravaged by volcanoes in the recent past, the serene chain of islands is a quiet place to lay eyes upon beaches of black sand, green ridges, and herds of wandering sheep. Known for its fishing industry, the main town is a sleepy place nestled below stunning scenery. The ferry arrives and departs several times a day from the mainland, and may be worth skipping for an extra day exploring this little geological wonder.",
"The Georgian Military Highway meanders through the deep valleys of the Caucasus Mountains, forming the only link from Russia into Georgia. In winter, the highway is maintained despited heavy snow in order to facilitate cargo transit, as well as support ski traffic.

Glaciers, clouds, and solitude are some of the magnificent treasures of this high altitude corner of the globe."
